September 11, 2001, we were shocked to confront enemies on our
doorstep. Our policy prior to the attack, to give in to the demands of
hijackers, had been rooted in our assumption that hijackers want to
live. Relying totally on this premise, our policy invited disaster.</font></font>

                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">We
learned this lesson the hard way. But our government felt it had to do
much more than learn a lesson. Two wars later we are burdened with
continued violence and unending expense in Iraq. Our budget and debt
are out of control. Inflation is detectable and
the Federal Reserve has carried out its usual series of interest rate
increases.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">The
financial profligacy of the Vietnam era led to the stagflation of the
late 1970's and early 1980's, when interest rates peaked at over
twenty percent. Could we afford the taxes to pay twenty percent
interest on our current debt? If not, what then? More debt to finance
the interest? That way lies ruin.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Looking
farther back, we are reminded of the founding of the Federal Reserve in
1913, followed not so many years later by the worst depression in
American history. Many economists link the first event with the second,
and observe how the depression helped to bring on World War II.
Evidently, ideas matter.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Libertarians
have always faulted our use of fiat money, preferring that it be backed
by gold or other commodities. Fiat money is money whose use is mandated by law,
which is issued without promise of redemption by the issuer. It has no intrinsic value. That
it has any value at all follows only from the use of force; we must use
it to pay taxes, and as legal tender. Everyone must pretend that it has
value, and so it seems to have it. But there are unintended
consequences. Its value slips. There has been far more inflation since
1913 than in the preceding century. Also, the supply of dollars is
closely controlled by the federal government; it is not automatically
increased by the availability of commodities that can be posted as loan
collateral. During the great depression, there were full silos of grain
all over the mid-west at the same time that unemployment exceeded
twenty percent and people had little money. This phenomenon is
described with the economist's gloss: it is difficult to push a string.
It might not have been so difficult to push that string if people had
been free to devise and use their own currencies. Laws that prohibit
the natural order of things also matter.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">
      It must be admitted that commodity currencies also
have disadvantages. Financial tycoons, able to affect the market for
gold or silver, can wreak havoc for a while. But here, simple remedies
come to mind. First of all, world markets are now so large that it is
more difficult than ever to corner a market. Secondly, absent the bias
favoring a single currency, multiple currencies based on different
commodities would allow one to spread the risk, just as one does in
investing. In any case, though depressions also preceded 1913, they
were not deemed &quot;great depressions&quot;. It seems that achieving a great
depression requires considerable help from government.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">The
use of multiple currencies might also pressure government to tax with
uniform (flat) rates. Such rates would make sense in any currency. In
developing countries, the freedom to use foreign currencies is a
familiar popular demand.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">The
use of a single fiat currency provides far more convenience to
government than to the rest of us. Every aspect of such currency is a
source of income for government. It benefits from seigniorage in
dispensing cash. It charges banks for loans at arbitrary rates it
itself sets. Then it borrows to finance its elective wars and other
extravagance and taxes us for the interest on the debt. Income tax is
progressive, so that with inflation and bracket creep we all start
paying at the rates once intended for the wealthy. Inflation rewards
debtors, such as the government itself. That it impoverishes others may
be regretted, but is likened to an act of God.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Adding
insult to injury, whatever mischief is caused by government
intervention in currency and the economy is blamed on the &quot;business
cycle&quot;. The causes of our misfortune are wrongly assigned by academics,
who indoctrinate youth to have blind faith in government, and so in the
use of force to solve every problem.</font></font>

      Economics is reputed to be a
mysterious subject, understood only by the initiated. Where it should be
a scientific study of voluntary exchange between and among individuals, in our world it has become
the study of Federal regulation, force and plunder. When given a choice, people 
reject fiat money as having no value. We are denied that choice.</font></font>

                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Economic apologists
tell us that fiat money is just like the gold standard, or the pound sterling,
but without the gold, or the silver. But the regulation of fiat money
requires artificial manipulation of the interest rate, causing boom and
bust, full employment and unemployment, just to maintain a stable
currency. This is surely <i>not</i> like the gold standard.</font></font>

is supposed to be an accounting device, used to measure and enable
economic activity. Fiat money, unable to preserve its value without
wrecking the economy it is supposed to serve, has become the master
rather than the servant.</font></font>

                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
world of prices, accounting, and money reflects as in a mirror the real
world of industry and commerce. Any transaction in goods or services is
accompanied by a transfer of money. In order that the looking-glass
world of finance should provide a true reflection of the real world
outside, the setting of prices must be unconstrained by forces beyond
the parties taking part in the transaction. Only then will prices
reflect the unbiased judgment of the parties, and the benefits of the
free market be realized.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Take
a simple example. An industrious cobbler produces shoes and makes a
bundle of money, which he hides under the bed. A burglar robs this
money. To some economists <a href="#Sam2">[Sam 2]</a> little harm has
been done, for the money will no doubt be used, so is still in
circulation. But great harm has been done to the relationship between
the cobbler's industry and his consequent savings. The burglar made no
shoes or anything else of value, yet ended up with the money. The image
in the money mirror is now a highly distorted view of the real world of
production and consumption.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
reason that a free market (without theft) provides superior results is
that no deal occurs save by the mutual consent of the parties to the
deal. A buyer would prefer a lower price; a seller a higher one. The
price at which they can agree thus becomes an important piece of
economic data, used by everyone in making decisions. When prices are
distorted from these natural levels, the information is wrong, and
subsequent decisions that rely on this data tend also to be wrong.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Price
controls are justly criticized on this basis. Probably the largest
single case of controlled prices is the interest rate on money. The
government has mandated the use of dollars, then subjected dollars to
massive price control via an interest rate administered by the Federal
Reserve. Just as price controls on gasoline produced massive shortages
in the 1970's, so this mandating and control of the U.S. dollar has led
to much of the economic mischief we have experienced over recent
history.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
looking glass to which we have been referring above has a name: it is
called <i>accounting</i>. In order for the image in the looking glass to be
reliable, accounting rules must be followed. The total of assets must equal
the total of liabilities. A unit of currency is a liability of the issuing bank. It once
could be exchanged on demand for a unit of the bank's assets, such as gold
or silver. In issuing fiat currency, the Federal Reserve Bank effectively breaks
the mirror.

time has passed since the founding of the Federal Reserve that economic
theory has come to better understand the behavior of fiat money. The
views of the Chicago school, once held in low repute by many, have
become widely accepted. The further contributions of the Austrian
school are also better known than previously.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">The
Chicago school observed the inverse relationship between the quantity
of money and its value. When the quantity of money increased markedly,
as after the discovery of gold in the new world, the effect was to
reduce the price of gold, and so to increase the prices of everything
else when these prices were expressed in terms of gold. History records
the resulting inflation in prices.</font></font>

                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font  size="3">The same thing happens with fiat money. As
government &quot;eases credit&quot;, that is, increases the quantity of money,
prices soon begin to rise. The effect happens unevenly, producing
winners and losers, instability and inefficiency. Prices eventually
rise in direct proportion to the quantity of money; that is the value
of the dollar varies in inverse proportion to the quantity of money.</font></font>

      Science students will recognize this
relationship as the ideal gas law. The pressure of the gas is the value
of the dollar. The quantity of gas is the number of dollars in
circulation. In the ideal gas law their product is constant. The
&quot;constant&quot; with fiat money depends on such factors as the <i>velocity </i>of
money, that is, how often it it enters into a transaction, and on the
interest rate. So variations in these two things affect prices and
inflation. Of these two, the interest rate is the one that is more
easily observed. Its effect must be highly indirect, since the Federal
Reserve must vary it over a wide range in order to control inflation.</font></font>

      Economists of the left <a href="#Sam1">[Sam 1]</a>
have sometimes seen the national debt as an aid in stabilizing the
currency. If it does this, it certainly does it badly and at immense
cost. The interest on the debt is one of the largest items in the
Federal budget, transferring wealth from taxpayers to savers, in
risk-free loans. Savers, as a group, tend to be wealthy. Why is this result 
favored by the left wing, the liberals?</font></font>

      Gold had the advantage that its quantity could
not be cheaply increased, nor would it likely be destroyed. Fiat money
can easily be created and destroyed, and government has assumed the
power to do this. But we will see in the next section that there is
reason to doubt that any means exists whereby the Federal Reserve could
exercise this power without massive pain to the economy.</font></font>

      Whereas private firms using sound accounting
practices are required to make their assets and liabilities stay
precisely in balance, and so can offer precisely the amount of currency
for which they have the redeeming assets, the Federal Reserve offers
only gas. The value of the dollar is spongy, not firm. As with a casino

      The government is currently able to raise the
debt to any level, pay any rate of interest required to obtain the
unsecured loans, and charge the taxpayer for the interest, even if the
economy be destroyed. This is how many earlier civilizations came to
grief. <a href="#Adams1">[Adams 1] </a>Experience indicates that to
control the inflation of fiat money, the interest rate must exceed the
rate of inflation. This becomes impossible with runaway inflation as
experienced in many countries. Prudence dictates that the use of fiat
money should be abandoned.</font></font>

      Anyone who has followed business news knows how
the Federal Reserve chairman uses negative feedback in trying to
control inflation. When he feels that inflation is increasing, he
raises the interest rate on various government loans and securities.
When inflation is low he reduces interest rates. In this way he tries
to give fiat money the appearance of constant value, where in fact no
value exists. If this technique had a theoretical basis, worked well,
and had no significant disadvantages, we would owe the Federal Reserve
our thanks. But unfortunately none of these things is so.</font></font>

      We can see from the historical record that the
technique does not work well. Rather, interest rates vary widely over
time, from nearly zero recently to over twenty percent in the early
1980's. The economy experiences inflation, recession, and at least
once, stagflation, that is, inflation and stagnation at the same time.
In most foreign countries the record is even more dismal than in the
U.S. Many countries have seen their currencies lose 99 percent of their
value over a relatively short time period. <a href="#Foot2">[2]</a></font></font>

      The costs of this intervention in the economy
are immense. When interest rates are high, our perpetually large
national debt produces a massive interest load on U.S. taxpayers. In
1988 interest on the debt exceeded 40 percent of personal income tax
receipts. <a href="#Foot3">[3]</a> This represents a large transfer
payment from ordinary people to the wealthy, who own most of the the
bonds and securities. Thus, the effect is regressive, a fact sheepishly
admitted by liberal economists. [<a href="#Sam3">Sam 3]</a> When
interest rates are high, investors prefer bonds to corporate stock, so
stock prices are depressed. Money is also less available to consumers,
so demand suffers. The entire economy is depressed, and unemployment
increases. Since both supply and demand are depressed, the effect on
prices, which was the purpose of the policy, is somewhat muted. A large
intervention produces only a modest result. Money is moved from
spending and useful investment in industry into government bonds. A
recession is announced. Murray Rothbard provides a more detailed
analysis of these phenomena. [<a href="#Roth1">Roth 1]</a></font></font>

      After the recession, interest rates are low.
Industry has been chastened, and has reason to doubt the return of
consumer demand and investor confidence. Often, the recovery takes
years. Money, though cheap in terms of the interest rate, does not go
where it would have been absent the boom and bust. The economy is back
at square one, and each participant must prove himself all over again.</font></font>

      So much for the significant disadvantages of
fiat money. How about the theoretical basis? Feedback is an idea from
engineering. One might think that a formal technical justification had
been developed in the academic literature for regulating fiat money in
this way, with either formal proofs or extensive simulations showing
that the technique is sound. This has never been done.</font></font>

      Suppose the Fed chairman had access to a magical
parameter that could be varied to produce a proportional change in all
prices, thus avoiding price distortion. Then a second parameter could
be defined in terms of the first so that prices would vary in direct
proportion to this second parameter. Without loss of generality
therefore we may assume that his magical parameter has this additional
property. But prices are also set by sellers, or by buyers and sellers
in mutual agreement. The collection of equations setting prices as we
have just described is thus an over-constrained linear system with no
solution unless all prices are zero.</font></font>

      The common-sense interpretation of this trivial
but interesting result is that if prices are set by market
participants, they cannot also be set by the Fed. The Fed cannot affect
prices except by itself participating in the economy in a major way so
as to distort prices and so influence the behavior of the other market
participants enough to achieve its goals. Of course this is what
actually happens, at great cost to us all. Thus does money become the
master rather than a servant.</font></font>

bank would promise to exchange the certificates for gold or other
commodity in accordance with its contract commitments. It would also be
authorized to issue new certificates in exchange for suitable commodity

currency would be kept exactly in step with the market price of the

commodity currencies would be expected to inflate or deflate over a
long time period. If the effect were slow, it would not matter a great
deal. The famous wager between Julian Simon and Paul Ehrlich supports the optimists, that
commodities will get cheaper. Environmental pessimists would tend to
support Paul Ehrlich, expecting them to become more expensive. The
optimists then would expect price inflation in terms of their

to Murray Rothbard, [<a href="#Roth2">Roth 2]</a> business cycles
started in the eighteenth century, when some European banks began the
practice of issuing more money certificates than they had gold or
silver on deposit. This <i>fractional reserve</i> banking has
persisted ever since. Now, however, since no redeeming commodities are
used at all, the fractional reserve idea is used by the central bank
to limit the amount by which ordinary banks may increase the money
supply on their own. The central bank directs the other banks, and
retains the power to vary the money supply at will. The use of
fractional reserves has been defended primarily as a way of increasing
the quantity of money. Its defenders claim that a modern economy

Commodity Market.</i> If a commodity currency became somewhat scarce,
this scarcity would be immediately be transferred to the commodity
itself, raising its price. This would stimulate the production of the
commodity in the usual way. Conversely, a reduction in demand would
tend to lower the price, discouraging production, and increasing
scarcity. The self-regulating nature of free markets thus translates
into a natural means of regulating the value of a commodity currency.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>Hot
Potato Money. </i>Investment advisers have long pointed out that gold
does not make a good long-term investment. Over time it loses value in
comparison with any good stock or bond. Why is this? First, gold held
in deposit is not financing investment in productive enterprise. There
is no way that gold can produce a dividend or interest. But even worse,
the fact that it is valuable means that it must be protected and
defended at some cost. Security measures are expensive, and the owner
of the asset is the one who must pay. For this reason, commodity money
cannot be expected to produce any positive interest, but only charges.
This amounts to negative interest.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">There
can be no clearer indication that fiat money is inflationary and thus
unsuitable for use as currency than the fact that it produces, without
risk, positive interest in savings accounts or government bonds. No
currency that truly held its value could do this, unless it were a part
of a program for the forced redistribution of wealth. To the extent
that the dollar is in fact involved in such a program of
redistribution, the effect is regressive, as mentioned before.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
negative interest on commodity money would mean that, like the change
in one's pocket, it would be owned and held only briefly. Users would
quickly pass it on to others in trade, putting their assets into goods
or appreciating securities: stock and bonds. It would provide a unit of
measure, like the physical units, the meter, gram, or second. One does
not need a barn full of yardsticks; one or two suffice.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
natural disincentive to hold onto commodity money for very long would
tend to increase its effectiveness in trade. The disincentive would
tend to increase the frequency or velocity with which it was used in
successive transactions, and so increase its usefulness.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>Multiple
Currencies. </i>One of the myths of modern life is that a modern state
must have a single official currency. Never mind that we insist on a
multiplicity of nearly everything else, including investment
instruments. We deplore monopoly in the private sector, but exempt the
public sector from the same skeptical scrutiny.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Foreign
developing nations have had such bad experiences with official
currencies that there is often popular demand for the ability to use
several currencies. World trade requires the use of multiple
currencies, so that dealing in them has become routine in commerce.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">If
different currencies, each using a particular commodity, were issued by
private banks, then the free market would sort out the winners from the
losers, and we would be left with a few widely used currencies.
Exchange in kind, with any one of these few currencies, would be nearly
cost-free; only exchanges among different currencies would have an
appreciable cost. There would be a need to maintain stockpiles of the
most popular commodities, tending to stabilize their prices. The
ability to institute new currencies at any time using stockpiles of any
suitable commodity would prevent the depression effect: stockpiles
existing at the same time that there is a shortage of money.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
law would be changed to permit the use of any private currency to pay
debts, even for paying taxes.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>Payment
Clearing Techniques</i>. Banks discovered long ago that they could
conduct business more inexpensively if they cleared their mutual debts
in large batches. Debts incurred though checks issued on other banks
were combined perhaps once a day. Net debit or credit amounts were
struck, and payments made from net debtors to net creditors.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">The
process was simplified further by the formation of clearing houses with
their own accounts. Rather than each net debtor paying many other
banks, debtors would first pay the clearing house, which would then pay
the net creditors. This reduced the total number of payments required,
and so permitted the process to be conveniently extended to a larger
number of banks.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">More
recently, some large clearing houses have adopted automated clearing
techniques. Payment orders are held in queue until such time as
suitable account balances are available for their transmission to recipient
banks. Then the payments are automatically released. Using such
techniques, CHIPS (the Clearing House Interbank Payment System) has
been able to accomplish the release of between $1 and $1.5 trillion per
day with total bank deposits totaling about $3 billion, for a clearing
ratio of several hundred to one. These techniques accomplish the early
pre-settlement of the large majority of the daily volume of work, in
nearly balanced exchanges. The larger daily net positions of the bank
participants are contained within relatively few (mostly large) payments that are settled at
end of day.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Fractional
reserve banking boasts a money creation multiplier of perhaps only five
or six to one. When the reserve currency is fiat currency, achieving
even this small advantage is pointless. Even when the reserve currency
was gold, fractional reserves perpetrated a fraud on the public, in
that loan-backed money was commingled with hard currency. The Jimmy
Stewart character in “It's a Wonderful Life” had to explain to irate
bank customers that their money had actually been invested in
mortgages, without their full knowledge or consent. In our scheme,
different types of money and securities would be honestly represented
and sold for what they are.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">In
sum, modern clearing methods could increase the effectiveness of
commodity currency, as they today increase the effectiveness of dollar
holdings. This would reduce the currency volume required for the
conduct of business.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3"><i>Non-Commodity
Instruments.</i> Only financial laws and regulations prevent us from
using brokerage instruments such as money market funds or REIT funds
(Real Estate Investment Trusts) to settle debts. If both buyer and
seller keep assets in such forms, they could agree to use the current
price of the fund in terms of gold or other commodity to determine the
price expressed in shares of the fund. Then shares could be transmitted
in payment. This would avoid the transaction charges that might be
incurred under current law. Currently, the buyer would have to sell
shares for dollars, pay in dollars, then the seller would have to
invest the dollars. Conversion usually incurs greater cost than payment
in kind. Only the law prevents this improved efficiency.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">If
securities funds could represent currency, the potential volume of
currency would be truly huge. There could no longer be any claim that
the needs of a modern economy require fractional reserve banking or
fiat money. The long era of the “business cycle” might finally end, and
with it one cause of misery, mischief and war.</font></p>

                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Price
indexing has been proposed as an alternative to commodity money. <a
 href="#MFriedman2">[MFriedman 2]</a> At first glance it might appear
that indexing might provide better regulation of the value of money
than even commodity money could offer, at lower cost. Unfortunately,
the notion of price indexing does not immediately suggest how to design
a currency.</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">One
possible use for an index might be in writing very long-term contracts.
Contracted amounts to be paid well in the future might be indexed to
compensate for commodity price changes over that time. One type of
index that comes to mind is the price of labor. A national income
percentile (such as the 50th percentile or median income) might be used
to provide an index. This idea could be of interest to seniors shopping
for pensions. Hayek has expressed doubt that sufficient demand would
exist even in this case.<br>
      </font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">How
would this work? An annuity contract might be written that specifies
payments to be paid in future months in terms of a fraction of the
annual median income as posted by a suitable independent organization
or government agency. A senior who could have thirty or more years of
life ahead would then be much better protected against the effects of
inflation than is currently the case with an income fixed in dollars.<br>
      </font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Note
that if a price index were used to regulate a fiat currency through
negative feedback, we would be left with the situation already treated
earlier. It has been shown that manipulation of the interest rate by the Federal Reserve
distorts the structure of prices in the economy. We will see in the next section
proposals for asset-backed currency that should be free from this defect. </font></p>

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Hayek
      <a href="#Hayek">[Hayek]</a> has suggested that private banks
could issue a superior currency, since market forces would compel them
to succeed. I agree, except that unlike Hayek, I do not feel that this
should be a fiat currency, but rather should be either   <!-- check references -->
commodity currency, well-established stocks, and bonds based on mortgages or
secured loans. This is closer to current practice, and seems far
more sound. </font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">Here
is a concrete proposal that we will call <i> free brokerage,</i>
that takes a step beyond the older notion of free banking. Suppose that government leaves
the creation of money to the private sector, and repeals laws taxing securities. It would
allow shares in any security to be used as valuable consideration (money) in any
financial deal. Brokers could act as banks, transferring shares from one person's
account to another based on checks or electronic orders, at zero or low cost. 
</font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">We would expect
that a demand would arise for mutual funds that behave like Hayek's proposed
money, by being based on a basket of commodities. Fund managers could design mutual funds
that roughly track the median income in value; that is, by this measure they neither inflate
nor deflate much over time. Those making time deals, employers and employees, borrowers and lenders,
pension funds and pensioners could elect to use shares in such funds as a basis for their contracts.
Employers, borrowers, and pension funds tend to be pleased by inflation and unhappy with 
deflation, while employees, lenders and pensioners have the opposite preferences. All parties
might therefore be willing to agree on the use of a fund share that succeeded in being
inflation neutral. Funds whose shares exhibit this property reliably over many years would
earn a favorable reputation for use as money. They would win acceptance in the free market for these uses.
      </font></p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial" size="3">It would be well for such
inflation-neutral mutual funds, when using corporate stock, to restrict themselves to preferred stock
in debt-free corporations.
This would both decrease investment risk and prevent control of
the underlying corporations by governments.
Similarly, their loan-based bonds and securities should be 
restricted to fully collateralized loans, such as mortgages and inventory loans.
Of course, select commodities could also be used to achieve the fund's goal of being
inflation neutral.

                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">We
agree with Hayek, as well as with many other distinguished economists,
that private currency is perfectly feasible, and would provide a
superior alternative to government fiat money. Again with Hayek, we
find that the notion that there must be only one currency in a given
nation is without merit. It is a myth used to exalt the role of
government, but provides no advantage to business or to the individual
citizen. Indeed, it has dramatic disadvantages.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">What
changes would occur if these ideas were put into practice? The Federal Reserve
would be phased out, and with it fiat money and the practice of regulating
monetary value by manipulating the interest rate. Banks would
assume a new function, that of depository for the commodity backing of
money. They would give up the power to create loans with fractional
reserves. Instead, different classes of money would exist separately,
actively traded in the market. Loans could be created through the issuance of
investment instruments. We have mentioned REIT's as an example of such
instruments in current use.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Brokers
would be granted a new power, to serve as banks for security funds and
instruments, with the power to transfer bond and loan fund shares among
their customers as a secondary form of money. The taxation of such
securities would have to be simplified or eliminated to make this
possible. It is doubtful that a distinction between banking and
brokerage functions would be needed in such a system.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">It
is imperative that taxes and other debts could be paid in any commodity
or equity and loan-based money. If tax rates were flat, no particular currency
would assume special importance. If government continued to insist on
progressive taxation, indexing via income percentiles could provide a
way to achieve this, without bracket creep, and without a distinguished
currency.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">Federal
bonds would remain, but they would be bought and sold in a commodity
or other private currency. 
 The government might also obtain loans from private banks,
but the charters of these banks would require that adequate marketable
collateral be posted, as with a mortgage or home equity loan. The
national debt could gradually be converted into a debt denominated in
private currency. These changes would reduce the power of the Federal
Government to borrow as much as it does at present. The advantages of
the new system would not be fully achieved unless the power of the
government were curtailed in other ways as well. Nevertheless, denying
government the powers to issue fiat currency and to have a monopoly on
currency would tend to restrain its excesses significantly.</font></font>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">There
would be no legal tender law equating one form of money with another, as
under our fractional reserve system dollars are partially loan based and partially
pure fiat money.  </font></font>

                        <p style="text-indent: 0.2in;"><font face="Arial"><font size="3">If
all of this were done, with banking reconstituted and government
restrained, the largest single source of economic instability would
have been removed, and attention might then focus on lesser sources of
instability in both the public and private sectors.</font></font>
